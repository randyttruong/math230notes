\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Be able to understand and visualize
        the three-dimensional coordinate
        plane.
  \item Be able to draw basic
        objects in the three-dimensional
        coordinate plane
  \item Become fluent in the various
        attributes of the three-dimensional
        coordinate plane
  \item Be able to define a graph
        in set-builder notation
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation}
In former calculus classes (and former math
classes in general), we have learned how to
graph different objects in two-dimensional
space. We have also learned about a particular
way of graphing objects (or interpreting
coordinates), and that has been through
coordinate grids.

\par However, in multivariable calculus, we
want to move out of these two-dimesional
coordinate systems. Instead we want to
be able to understand graphs in the
third-dimensional coordinate system in order
to tackle more complex problems.

\section{What we already know}
\subsection{Cartesian Coordinate Systems}
The Cartesian Coordinate system, which
is also known as the \textbf{rectangular
  coordinate system} is a
coordinate system in which we locate our
points based on their position in relation
to the origin of the graph, based on the
x and y axes.
\begin{itemize}

  \item For example, given the following point:

        \[ (4,5)\]

        what exactly comes to mind?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item We shift the point 4 positive
                units along the x-axis from
                the origin.
          \item We shfit the point 5
                positive units along the y-axis
                from the origin.

        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Two-dimensional coordinate systems $ \R^{2} $}
Recall that real numbers are numbers that
can be used to express one-dimensional
quantities.
\begin{itemize}
  \item This basically includes
        every single number that can be
        plotted on the number line.
\end{itemize}
We denote real numbers in mathematics with
the following symbol:
\begin{center}
  $ \R $
\end{center}
$ \R $ represents all \textbf{real,  one-dimensional
  quantities.} We can, of course,
think of this as all of the numbers and points
that exist on the number line, since
the number line only contains one-dimension,
the scalar $x$.
By comparision, whenever we see
the following notation:
\[ \R^{2}\]
This means that are observing all \textbf{real, two-dimensional quantities}.
When we say, ``real, two-dimensional
quantities,'' we are referring to all of
the points that exist in the xy-plane, or
the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate
system.
\par By this logic, then, we know that if
$ \R^{2} $ represents a pair of real numbers,
we know that
\[ \R^{3} \]
represents a triple of all real numbers, in
the form of $ (x, y, z)$.

\subsection{Terminology in $\R^{2}$}
\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
  Axes
\end{definition}
\textbf{Axes} represent the way that a point can
``move'' in a coordinate plane.
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the one-dimensional coordinate
        system, we can only move along the
        x-axis: $ x $.
  \item In the two-dimensional
        coordinate system, we can move
        along both the x-axis and the y-axis:
        $ (x, y) $.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
  Quadrants
\end{definition}
\textbf{Quadrants} define the different
possible areas of the coordinate system a
point can exist on, which are based on
the signs of both the x and y values.
\begin{itemize}
  \item For example, there are
        four quadrants in the xy-plane, including
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Quadrant I: $ (+, +)$
          \item Quadrant II: $ (-, +)$
          \item Quadrant III: $ (-, -)$
          \item Quadrant IV: $ (+, -)$

        \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{The Three-Dimensional Coordinate
  Plane $\R^{3}$}

By what we know about the one-dimensional
coordinate system $ \R$ as $x$ and the
two-dimensional coordinate system $\R^{2}$
as $ (x, y)$, we must think of the
three-dimensional coordinate system $\R^{3}$
as $ (x, y, z)$.
\subsection{Terminology in $ \R^{3} $}

\begin{definition}
  Axes
\end{definition}

This is literally a copy of what we have
in $ \R $ and $ \R^{2} $, insofar that
we have the number of dimensions corresponding
to the exponent of $ \R $. Obviously, in
this case, since we are working in $ \R^{3} $,
we now have three dimensions to work with,
the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis.

\begin{definition}
  Octants
\end{definition}
Similarly to what we had in the two-dimensional
coordinate plane, we can distinguish what
general area a point in three dimensions is
going to occupy.
\begin{itemize}
  \item There is no good way to define
        which octant is which, but we can
        visualize it as the xy-plane quadrants,
        but just duplicated for all positive
        values of z and all negative values of
        z.
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}
  Planes
\end{definition}
\textbf{Planes} are objects that occupy
all real-numbers in two dimensions.
\par There are three planes in $ \R^{3} $
\begin{itemize}
  \item xy-plane
        \begin{itemize}
          \item We can think of this as
                all points in which $ z = 0 $.
          \item All  points
                that satisfy $ (x, y, 0) $,
                where $ x $ and $ y $ are
                real numbers.
        \end{itemize}

  \item yz-plane
        \begin{itemize}
          \item All points in which $ x = 0 $
          \item Any coordinates that satisfy
                $ (0, y , z )$ where
                $ y $ and $ z $ are
                real numbers.

        \end{itemize}
  \item xz-plane
        \begin{itemize}
          \item All points in which $ y = 0 $
          \item Any coordinates that
                satisfy $ (x, 0, z)$, where
                $ x $ and $ z $ are real
                numbers.

        \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Set-Builder Notation}
\subsection{What are sets?}
\textbf{Sets} are just collections of different
objects in mathematics.
\begin{itemize}
  \item We can think of sets as
        containing integers, variables,
        etc\dots
\end{itemize}
They are generally notated using \textbf{curly
  braces}.
\subsection{Examples of Sets}
\[ \{ 1, 2, 3, \dots \}\]
\[ \{ a, b, c, \dots \}\]

But, how do we define what kinds of objects we are
putting into our set?
\subsection{Set Builder Notation}
\textbf{Set Builder Notation} is a type of
mathematical notation that allows us to describe what
kinds of objects are in our sets and the properties of
such objects.

\par The generally follow the following format

\[ \{ \textrm{
    \textit{variable(s)}}: \textrm{\textit{condition(s) that define the variable(s)} }\}\]

\section{Drawing basic objects (points, lines, planes) in $
  R^{3}$}
Whenever we want to draw things in three dimensions, there
are a few things that we need to consider first.

\subsection{Drawing the Coordinate System and Right-Hand Rule}
Whenever we draw the three-dimensional coordinate system,
we must remember that there is a particular way in
which we draw the system. The best way to visualize
this is to use the \textbf{right-hand rule}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Our arm represents the y-axis, while our
        fingers represent the x-axis.
  \item Our thumb is always going to be pointing towards
        the z-axis.
  \item Make sure that whenever we are drawing
        a coordinate system that we are just rotating
        the system, rather than just ``mirroring'' it.
\end{itemize}
Otherwise, whenever we actually plot our points
and actually draw things in three dimensions, we need
to follow this algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Think of what happens to the object at the origin or
        think of the shape in two dimensions.
  \item Shift the object accordingly based on the
        third dimension.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Distance Between Two Points in Three-Dimensional
  Spacde}
\subsection{Distance in $ \R^{2} $}
\newtheorem{lem}{Formula}
\begin{center}
  \fbox{
    \parbox{\textwidth} {
      \begin{lem}
        Distance in $ \R^{2} $
        \[ \textrm{let $ d $ be distance}\]
        \[ d = \sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}} \]
    \end{lem}
    }
  }
\end{center}

\subsection{Distance in $ \R^{3} $}
\begin{center}
  \fbox{
    \parbox{\textwidth}{
      \begin{lem}
        Distance in $ \R^{3} $
        \[ \textrm{let $ d $ be distance}\]
        \[ d = \sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}+y_{1})^{2}
        + (z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}}\]
      \end{lem}
    }
  }
